I wanted to give id attributes for all elements but I found it hard to keep them all unique
    it felt unnecessary since I checkd a few websites and it seems to be a common practice to not have a id attribute for a lot of elements

    this is the first page I found, reusability is poor with unique id's + ref is a thing in react
